1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of systematic and quantifiable approach in the development, 
operation, maintenance; and retirement of software.


2. Importance of Software Engineering in the Technology Industry
Software engineering is vital in the technology industry because it:

1. Creates Applications: Software engineers build the applications we use every day, like social media, online shopping, and email.
2. Powers Systems: It helps develop complex systems that run businesses, manage databases, and control devices.
3. Improves Lives: Software engineers create tools that make communication easier, enhance entertainment, support healthcare, and enable many other aspects of modern life.
4. Ensures Quality: By using systematic methods, software engineering ensures that software is reliable, secure, and user-friendly.

3. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Structured Programming (1970s): This brought about improved code clarity and maintainability, laying the groundwork for modern programming practices.

Waterfall Model (1970s): This provided a structured approach to managing software projects, although later practices evolved to address its limitations.

Agile Methodologies (2001): This revolutionized software development by making it more adaptable to change and focused on delivering customer value through frequent, incremental updates.


4. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle
Software Specification: what the system should do and its development and operational
constraints
Software Development: production of the software system according to specification
Software Validation: checking that the software product has the customer specified functionalities
Software Evolution: changing the software in response to changing user and work demands.

5. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall model, also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model was the first software 
process model to be introduced and is. It consists of separate and distinct phases of specification and 
development.
The phases of waterfall model include
a. Requirements analysis and definition
b System and software design
c. Implementation and unit testing
d. Integration and system testing
e. Operation and maintenance.

Scenario: A factory is producing a machine with detailed specifications.

While agile methodologies are  set of principles and practices designed to manage projects in a flexible and iterative way. They focus on collaboration, customer feedback, and continuous improvement. Agile is especially popular in software development but can be applied to various types of projects.

The phases of agile methodologies include
a. Concept
b. Inception
c. Iteration
d. Release
e. Maintenance
f. Retirement.

Scenario: A team is making a new app but isn’t sure exactly what features users will want.

6. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- Software Developer: Writes and maintains code to build the software.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests the software to find and fix bugs before release.
- Project Manager: Plans, organizes, and manages the project to ensure it’s completed on time and within scope.

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers face challenges like dealing with bugs, managing time, keeping up with technology, handling complex requirements, collaborating with teams, and balancing work with personal life.

Overcoming these challenges involves clear communication, effective time management, continuous learning, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Checks small, individual pieces of code to make sure they work on their own.
Integration Testing: Ensures that different parts of the software work well together.
System Testing: Tests the entire application to confirm it meets all requirements and works as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Validates that the software meets user needs and is ready for release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and crafting the input or "prompts" given to AI models to get the best possible responses.

Importance
- Get Better Answers
- Clear Instructions
- Avoid Misunderstandings
- Save Time
- Efficient Communication
- Improve AI Performance
- Maximize Capabilities


2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
Prompt: "Tell me about movies."

Improved Prompt:
Prompt: "Give me a list of the top 5 action movies released in 2023."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
Specific Request: By specifying "top 5 action movies released in 2023," you guide the AI to focus on a particular category and time period, making the answer more relevant to what you need.
Reduces Ambiguity: It eliminates uncertainty about what kind of movie information you’re looking for, so the AI can give a precise response.
Saves Time: You get the exact information you want without having to sift through a broad or irrelevant response.
